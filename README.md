# Kohanek Astrophysics Project
This is the source code for my Nonfiction Book project. I just want 
to let it be known that git is a pain in the neck. It took me like 
30 minutes of figuring our the problem before I was able to upload 
this code to github. The problem was because I edited some code on 
this website, instead of the IDE that I use, so when I tried to 
upload new code from the IDE, it freaked out. Now I know:

Always do your pushes from the place you write your code, no matter 
how small

All of the connections made in this presentation are awesome, and you 
should take to time to get yourself familiar with them.

I don't care about making money off my code, and it's not like it's 
trademarked or anything. I don't have it under a license either, so 
if you see something you like, you can take it without problem. It 
would be kinda cool if you gave me credit in a liscense.txt file, 
but it's not like anyone reads those anyways.

Anyone who knows what they are looking at in the code section will know 
that my html and css skills are pretty bad. I can get what I want to 
look at, but the code is really messy. So, sorry for that :(
