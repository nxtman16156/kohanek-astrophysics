# Astrophysics for people in a hurry
My project for the book: Astrophysics for people in a hurry by Neil deGrasse Tyson

If you are here, I guess either I sent you the link, or you were actually currious 
when you saw the url to this page as I was presenting. If you know what the stuff 
in the code tab is, you can look at it, but read the following disclaimer:

I didn't spend as much time on this website as I have spent on other ones, so the 
produce looks good, but the code is pretty trashy because I haven't cleaned it up. 
Also, if you like good comments, you aren't going to find any here. In fact, there 
are a total of 0 comments in this code :).

I finished the build process to heroku just now (Wednesday), so that I didn't have 
to project my code to the class before clicking run and then going to the now active
url. oof.

Also, idk why I'm writing this file, 'cause it's not like it means anything to anybody...

I don't see why you shouldn't be able to use anything that's in here for money besides 
the pictures. For example, if you like the javascript snippet that handles remote 
scrolling (as I do), have at it. Pretty much if you like anything you see in the code, 
you can use it. Just kinda hide a liscense file in your source code with like my name 
in it and what feature you borrowed.

Peter Russell: The Awesome Remote Control Scrolling Feature

Like that. Save it in a liscense.txt (As if anybody reads them anyways) and change the 
code to fit your needs.
